#rc.lua 
In my `rc.lua` configuration for AwesomeWM, I've crafted a minimalistic desktop setup. At the top of my screen, you'll notice two handy widgets that streamline my daily use.

First, there's the volume widget, adorned with a speaker icon and the current volume percentage. This widget allows me to swiftly adjust audio levels while providing a real-time display of volume changes.

Second, I've implemented a battery widget that keeps me informed about my laptop's battery status. It displays the charge percentage and a charging symbol, keeping me in the loop about whether my device is currently charging or discharging. This widget auto-updates at regular intervals, ensuring I always know my battery's health.

 For added convenience, I've set up key bindings for adjusting volume using my multimedia keys, offering seamless control over my audio settings. This minimal yet functional setup enhances my overall user experience, combining aesthetics with practicality.

I also have added a extra workspace tab naming it "0" . It can be accessed by super key(windows key)+ 9 which will take you to worskpace 9 and the super key + right arrow key.
